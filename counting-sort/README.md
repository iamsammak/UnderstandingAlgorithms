# Counting Sort

An algorithm for sorting a collection of objects according to keys that are small integers.

Its running time is linear in the number of items and the difference between max and mim key values, so it is only suitable for direct use in situations where the variation in keys is not significantly greater than the number of items.

Allows us to sort an array in O(n) time.
